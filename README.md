# AngularRESTClient | Itexico AMC's Examples

A simple example client made in angular, to consume from a RESTful API from an external location.

## The goal

The main cause of building this is to provide a reference for me and the team when... 

- building Angular Aplications, 
- interacting with web services and RESTful APIs
- using dependency/package management with NPM and Bower
- using automation with Grunt (probably will make a GULP build later on)

## Getting Started

First we want to make sure our environment is all setup, for this we will need to install the next stuff...

**NodeJS** | Install node from [this link right here](http://nodejs.org/), just follow the steps, wither in windows or 
unix based OSs, check if you installed it correctly by running the next comamand on your cli

    node --version

and

    npm --version
    
npm is going to be our package manager for all backend related stuff

**Bower**  | After installing NodeJS, you should have an instance of NPM installed as well, try this by running the next command:

    npm install -g bower
    
this will install Bower globally, wich is going to be our package manager for all frontend related stuff.

Ok, now we are ( *almost* ) ready to start ...
